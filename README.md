To build and run the project use the bash script `src/runscript.sh`
Provide the script with the name of an input script, so it know what to pass to the executable.

If I wanted to build and pass `src/Assets/nonhier.lua` then I would `./runscript.sh nonhier`
That would then open the generated image `nonhier.png` (assuming the name of the image generated is the same, which hopefully it should be)
